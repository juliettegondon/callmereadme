  ## Description
  This project uses javascript, node, npm, and markdown to dynamically generate README files from user input. Within the command line, the user will be prompted with a series of questions and information that will populate onto a README.md page. Multiple functions were written across the index.js page and the generateMarkdown.js page - functions that initialize the program and write the file using input from the inquirer object. The generateMarkdown function appends all information to the README.md file, and each time this is run in the terminal the previous file is overwritten.
